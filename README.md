SOLID Principles:

  => Single Responsibility Principle:
    --> A class should only have one reason to change. 
    --> Separation of concerns - differenct class handling different, independent tasks/problems. 
    
  => Open-closed Principles:
    --> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
    
  => Liskov Substitution Principle:
    --> You should be able to substitue a subclass for a baseclass. 
    
  => Interface Segregation Principle:
    --> Don't put too much into an interface; split into separtate interfaces. 
    --> YAGNI: You Ain't Gonna Need It. 
    
  => Dependency Inversion Principle:
    --> Hign-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions(interfaces/ abstract classes. )
